Here we f* go! I'm soo ready to dive into all sorts of kewl libraries, functions and litteral geniousness in this book!
When I was a kid, I didn't think mush of books, or at least not the same way as I do in adult life.
I've read numerous books, but fiction, cult and that kina jazz never really got to me. Storries about happenings around the country and 
world, like documentaries - (gah, I love documentaries). Those storries, based on reality, those are the exiting!

Horror as fiction falls rather short in my book.
