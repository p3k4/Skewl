Here we f* go! I'm soo ready to dive into all sorts of kewl libraries, functions and litteral geniousness in this book!
When I was a kid, I didn't think mush of books, or at least not the same way as I do in adult life.
I've read numerous books, but fiction, cult and that kina jazz never really got to me. Storries about happenings around the country and 
world, like documentaries - (gah, I love documentaries). Those storries, based on reality, those are the really exiting!

Horror as fiction falls rather short in my book. - Famous last words, lol!

Making my way to grab some beer from the local shop. Tonight, I'm once again going to the skies! Quite literary actually. You see, YR which is the
national weather-station-thingy. They have data shared to a python library, and I'm gonna make something with that data!

Soo, I didn't end up doing the weather-forecast as of just yet. No big supprice there, lol. You see early on, like page 3 in the book - even, before the bloody installation process! They throw a task at you: "create a set of instructions you can use, for doing the grocery shopping. Add in stuff like "if" (yes, pay attention to the IF) - I'm out of milk, I should buy some milk". Like, what now exactly? What u mean, "a set of instructions"? 

So, I ended up making a "create yourself a shopping list"-program. Like, how vague are you gonna be?! Sir. "Set of instructions" - now that's not very clever init?

Yes, I'm still awake, casualy drinking, mostly writing - doing some thinking. I've decided to spend the night working on this shopping-program. It's just gonna keep me awake otherwise. Soo far, users can add products into a list and remove all the listed items. I wanted users to be able to remove the last added item, and this is where I got stuck for a bit. Looking at multiple options on how to solve this seemingly minor error. Though, I'm positive it's just a tiny error somewhere, but I wanna rewrite it all. You know, get some fresh perspective and maybe learn a bit more than I did version. What I can say to all of this is: God I've missed spending time listening to my [good taste of music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7GKqT5NA70ngPBX8XMdwZV?si=d77c8a69df5747c6), writing code and chilling with some booze. It sure brings back good memories! [SuperShopper Verion 1.0](https://github.com/p3k4/Skewl/blob/main/storage.py)

Well, took 5 hours, still got down to what the issue was, solved it buy editing how the interface worked. Could always be smoother, but its not too bad as it is now - need to make some comments so its easier to pick up later on I guess. Oh right, it's Friday. Guess it's time for some more beer. mm, yes, it is indeed. :D

Awright, Awright Awright! God some awesome tips on how to structure code in the future. Still need to figure a lot of this stuff out, but already knowing some programming in Java and Javascript sure help! It's still Friday, got some sleep and ready to spend the rest of the evening/night same as yesterday. Though, right now I just wanna finish the basics in program I started on. I still have lots of material to go through in the book.

Alright kids, it's not much but it's honest work.

Right, I've added [some of the introduction stuff](https://github.com/p3k4/Skewl/blob/main/notes_1.py) the book goes through - you know, still the absolute basics.
