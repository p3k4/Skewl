# Skewl
Repo name inspired by Eric Cartman. Because aside from the other kids around in South Park, that kid got ambitions! I'm writing notes and Python from a book I just ordered. Namely "Programming in School". ISBN: 9788215034287
Please Andreas and Henrik x2 - dont sue me, as I'm already broke. Thank you. I'm doing this puerly for my own educational purposes. No harm intended.
